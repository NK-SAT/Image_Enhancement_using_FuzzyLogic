# Image_Enhancement_using_FuzzyLogic
Fuzzy Grayscale Image Enhancement
Overview
This project implements a fuzzy logic-based image enhancement technique to improve the visual quality of grayscale and RGB images. The process involves dividing the image into smaller windows, applying fuzzy logic principles to enhance contrast and brightness, and merging the enhanced components to produce the final image.

Features
Grayscale and RGB Image Enhancement: Enhances both grayscale and RGB images by processing each color channel individually and combining them.
Fuzzy Logic-Based Enhancement: Uses fuzzy logic principles to enhance image contrast and brightness, resulting in improved visual quality.
Customizable Parameters: Allows customization of parameters such as the number of windows, gamma value, and ideal variance for tailored image enhancement.
